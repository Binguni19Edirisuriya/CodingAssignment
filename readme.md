Please **go though all points before you start** the assignment.

1. What is the development language?

    You can use any coding language. No restrictions

2. Can I use existing libraries?

    Yes, please. We encourage you to use any existing lubraries rather than re-inventing the wheel.

3. Can I take code pieces from the internet?

   Yes, you can. But you MUST mention the source location in the comments of the code. 

4. What will be the marking criteria?

   We will look at your approach, clarity of the code, usability of the application for a novice user, quality of the solution. (think like a QA person)

5. I dont have a cloud location to deploy the solution. What should I do?

   We encourage you to deploy the solution in a cloud location. It will be a task of the project. You 
   may find free hsoting facilities. Ex: Google is providing free $300 credits for all new users. You can have a 
   look at https://cloud.google.com/free. If you have questions regarding the deployments, we are happy to help. Please reach 
   us by email malintha@shoutout.ai
   
   Alternative is sending us a documentation with steps of deploying the entrire solution in a local machine. (We dont recommend this method.)
   
6. I have questions/ doubts about the task. What should I do?

   You can always write us. Please email your concerns during the task time window to malintha@shoutout.ai.
